SQL:
Structured Query Language
A standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive
    
    SELECT:
    Used to select data from a database
    The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set
        EX: 
        SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;  //SELECT Column Example
        SELECT * FROM Customers;  //SELECT * Example
    
    SELECT DISTINCT:
    Used to return only distinct (different) values
    Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values
        EX:
        SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;  //SELECT DISTINCT Examples
    
    WHERE:
    Used to filter records
    Used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition
    SQL requires single quotes around text values
    Numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes
    Can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators
        EX:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='Mexico';  //WHERE Clause Example (Text Fields)
        
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE CustomerID=1;  //Numeric Fields
    
    AND + OR + NOT: 
    Used to filter records based on more than one condition:
        The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE
        The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE
    The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE
    Can combine the AND, OR and NOT operators
        EX:
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';  //AND Example
        
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';  //OR Example
        
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE NOT Country='Germany';  //NOT Example
        
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München'); //Combining AND + OR Example
        
        SELECT * FROM Customers
        WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';  //Combining AND + NOT Example
